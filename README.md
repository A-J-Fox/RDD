# RDD
Simulations of regression discontinuity 

Simulations include both parametric regressions with dummy variables, and non-parametric regressions using rdrobust
The code can be used to recreate the simulations. Pdfs with the plots are supplied for a quick glance. 

- RDD-basics has the code for demonstrating/simulating basic RDD concepts
- RDD-failures demonstrates how non-linearity can create a false discontinuity
